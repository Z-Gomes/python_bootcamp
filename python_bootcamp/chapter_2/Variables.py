message = 'Hello, world'
print(message)

## this created a VARIABLE named 'message' here
# every variable is connected to a VALUE, which here is 'Hello, world'

message = 'Hello, Python world, take 2!'
print(message)

##adding another value to 'message' stores that value within the variable, and python will remember it, outputting both values with the print(message) command

print(message)

## this should generate an error because we've misspelled the 'message' variable
#python won't spellcheck code at all, but you need to ensure your spelling is consistent when referring to variables you've created
