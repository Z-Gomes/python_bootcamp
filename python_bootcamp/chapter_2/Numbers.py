## Integers
# you can add, subtract, multiply and divide integers

2+3
3-2
2*3
5/1

# python uses ** to represent exponents

2**2
10**6

# python supports order of operations so you can use multiple expressions in a single equation

2+3*4
(2+3)*4

## FLOATS
# floats are any number with a decimal point, which can appear at any position in a number
# you sometimes get an arbitrary number of decimal places in your answer, it's not a problem

0.1+0.2
0.5*1.1

#when dividing any two numbres, even if they are integers resulting in a whole number, you get return a float

20/5
10/2

#you can divide numbers up using underscores, which helps make the number more readable to others. python will ignore the underscores
newnumber = 1_000_000_000
print(newnumber)

## MULTIPLE ASSIGNMENT
#you can assign values to more than one variable in a single line
#you need to separate variable names with commas and do the same with the values they correspond to

variable_1, variable_2, variable_3 = 1,2,3
variable_1
variable_2
variable_3

## CONSTANTS
# a constant is a variable whose value stays the same throughout the life of a program
# python doesn't have built-in constant types, programmers use all caps to indicate a variable should be treated as a constant

CONSTANT = 1000
